      <span className='font-semibold text-green-500'> Collection</span> <br /> We partner with local municipalities, businesses, and community groups to set up collection points for used plastic bottles. This network of collection points makes it convenient for people to recycle their bottles and ensures a steady supply of materials.

      <br /><span className='font-semibold text-green-500'>Sorting and Cleaning</span> <br />Once collected, the bottles are transported to our recycling facility. Here, they are sorted by type and color to ensure uniformity in the recycling process. The bottles are then thoroughly cleaned to remove any contaminants, such as labels, caps, and residues.

      <br /><span className='font-semibold text-green-500'>Shredding and Pelletizing</span> <br /> The clean bottles are fed into shredders that break them down into small flakes. These flakes are then melted and formed into small pellets, which serve as raw material for manufacturing new plastic products.

      <br /><span className='mt-3 font-semibold text-green-500 text-start'>Manufacturing</span> <br /> The plastic pellets are sold to manufacturers who use them to create a wide range of products, including new bottles, packaging materials, textiles, and construction materials. This closed-loop system helps reduce the demand for virgin plastic, conserving natural resources and reducing environmental impact.

      <br /><span className='font-semibold text-green-500'>Education and Outreach</span> <br /> We run educational programs and campaigns to raise awareness about the importance of recycling and how individuals can contribute to a more sustainable future. These initiatives include school programs, community workshops, and media campaigns to encourage more people to participate in recycling efforts.

      <br /><span className='font-semibold text-green-500'>Research and Development</span> <br /> Our organization is committed to innovation and continually invests in research and development to improve recycling technologies and processes. This includes finding more efficient ways to recycle different types of plastics and developing new products from recycled materials.

      <br /><span className='font-semibold text-green-500'>Partnerships and Advocacy</span> <br /> We collaborate with governments, non-profits, and other organizations to advocate for policies and regulations that support recycling and sustainability. By working together, we can create a more significant impact and drive systemic change.
